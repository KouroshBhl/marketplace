General Rules:

- Always output executable, copy-pastable commands when suggesting changes.
- Always provide exact file diffs (patch-style) for modified files.
- Never say "run this yourself" without providing the exact commands.
- Keep changes minimal. Do NOT refactor unrelated files.

Monorepo Rules:

- This is a pnpm + Turborepo monorepo.
- apps/admin MUST NOT be modified unless explicitly requested.
- Shared UI components live in packages/ui only.
- Do NOT install shadcn inside apps (web/seller/admin).

Tech Rules:

- Tailwind v4 is used.
- Tailwind dependency is per app; Tailwind config is shared.
- Validation uses zod.
- Data fetching uses TanStack Query.

Output Rules:

- Prefer commands first, then file diffs.
- If required context is missing, ask for specific files instead of giving generic advice.
